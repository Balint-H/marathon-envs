# Marathon Environments
A set of high-dimensional continuous control environments for use with Unity ML-Agents Toolkit.

![MarathonEnvs](images/MarathonEnvsBanner.gif)

**MarathonEnvs** enables the reproduction of these benchmarks within Unity ml-agents using Unityâ€™s native physics simulator, PhysX. MarathonEnvs maybe useful for:

* Video Game researchers interested in apply bleeding edge robotics research into the domain of locomotion and AI for video games.
* Traditional academic researchers looking to leverage the strengths of Unity and ML-Agents along with the body of existing research and benchmarks provided by projects such as the [DeepMind Control Suite](https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control), or [OpenAI Mujoco](http://gym.openai.com/envs/#mujoco) environments.

*Note: This project is the result of a contribution from [Joe Booth (@Sohojo)](https://github.com/Sohojoe), a member of the Unity community who currently maintains the repository. As such, the contents of this repository are not officially supported by Unity Technologies.*

## What's new

### ml-agents 0.8.2 support

* Updated to work with ml-agents 0.8.2 / new inference engine

### Unity 2018.4 LTS

* Updated to use Unity 2018.4 LTS. Should work with later versions. However, sometimes Unity makes breaking physics changes.

### MarathonMan-v0

* Optimized for Unity3d + fixes some bugs with the DeepMind.xml version
* Merged from StyleTransfer experimental repro
* Replaces DeepMindHumanoid

### ManathonManSparse-v0

* Sparse version of MarathonMan.
* Single reward is given at end of episode.

### TerrainHopperEnv-v0, TerrainWalker2dEnv-v0, TerrainAntEnv-v0, TerrainMarathonManEnv-v0

* Random Terrain envionments
* Merged from AssaultCourse experimental repro

### SpawnableEnvs (Preview)

* Set the number of instances of an envrionmwnt you want for training and inference
* Envrionments are spawned from prefabs, so no need to manually duplicate
* Supports ability to select from multiple agents in one build
* Unique Physics Scene per Environment (makes it easier to port envionments however runs slower)
* SelectEnvToSpawn.cs - Optional menu to enable user to select from all agents in build

### Skip setting actions

* Option to not set actions when skipping steps. 
* Optimization for when running physics at high frequencey

### Scorer.cs

* Score agent against 'goal' (for example, max distance) to distinguish rewards from goals
* Gives mean and std-div over 100 agents

### Normalized Observations (-1 to 1) and reward (0 to 1)

* No need to use normalize flag in training. Helps with OpenAI.Baselines training

### Merge CameraHelper.cs from StyleTransfer. Controls are

* 1, 2, 3 - Slow-mo modes
* arrow keys or w-a-s-d rotate around agent
* q-e zoom in / out

### Default hyperparams are now closer to OpenAI.Baselines

* (1m steps for hopper, walker, ant, 10m for humanoid)

### Training speed improvements - All feet detect distance from floor

## Support and Contributing
 
**Support:** Post an issue if you are having problems or need help getting a xml working.

**Contributing:** Ml-Agents 0.6 supports the Gym interface. It would be of value to the community to reproduce more benchmarcks and create a set of sample code for various algorthems. This would be a great way for someone looking to gain some experiance with Re-enforcement Learing. I would gladdly support and / or partner. Please post an issue if you are interesgted. Here are some ideas:
 * [Hindsight Experience Replay (HER)](https://github.com/openai/baselines/tree/master/baselines/her)
 * [Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)](https://github.com/cbfinn/maml_rl) 
 * Any of A2C, ACER, ACKTR, DDPG, DQN, GAIL, PPO2, TRPO from [OpenAI.Baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines)
 * See [MarathonEnvsBaselines](https://github.com/Sohojoe/MarathonEnvsBaselines) - for an experimental implementation with OpenAI.Baselines and Stable.Baselines

### Tuning params / Magic numbers
* xxNamexx\Prefab\xxNamexx -> MarathonSpawner.Force2D = set to True when implementing a 2d model (hopper, walker)
* xxNamexx\Prefab\xxNamexx -> MarathonSpawner.DefaultDesity:
  * 1000 = default (= same as MuJoCo)
  * Note: maybe overriden within a .xml script
* xxNamexx\Prefab\xxNamexx -> MarathonSpawner.MotorScale = Magic number for tuning (scaler applied to all motors)
  * 1 = default () 
  * 1.5 used by DeepMindHopper, DeepMindWalker
  
* xxNamexx\Prefab\xxNamexx -> xxAgentScript.MaxStep / DecisionFrequency: 
  * 5000,5: OpenAIAnt, DeepMindHumanoid
  * 4000,4: DeepMindHopper, DeepMindWalker
  * Note: all params taken from OpenAI.Gym

### Important: 
* This is not a complete implementation of MuJoCo; it is focused on doing just enough to get the locomotion enviroments working in Unity. See Scripts/MarathonSpawner.cs for which MuJoCo commands and ignored or partially implemented.
* PhysX makes many tradeoffs in terms of accuracy when compared with Mujoco. It may not be the best choice for your research project.
* Marathon environments are running at 300-500 physics simulations per second. This is significantly higher that Unityâ€™s defaults setting of 50 physics simulations per second.
* Currently, Marathon does not properly simulate how MuJoCo handles joint observations - as such, it maybe difficult to do transfer learning (from simulation to real world robots)
